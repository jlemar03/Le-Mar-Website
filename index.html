        I have read many books in my career as a self proclaimed high-tier reader, and have used my venerable knowledge
        to create a list of absolute peak fiction. These books spread across many genres and formats, from niche chinese
        webnovels to renowned American classics. This list is meant to put you on books that, although might require
        more than a 1st grader's reading comprehension, are well written and have satisfying endings.

                    May be a bit lengthy for new readers, with books around 600-800 pages. A great book for fantasy

                    The Roaring 20s' were one of the most exciting times in American history. America had just
                    experienced the largest war ever, electricity is largely publicly used, and the economy is
                    booming(for the upper class). As Nick steps into his new home, he learns how the 1% and those
                    with old money live, and how unequivocally different their lives are to everyone else.

                    The Alchemist is a novel that tells the story of Santiago's quest for fortune, his Personal
                    Legend, and the decoding of the Language of the World. The young man must endure many
                    obstacles. First, he must overcome those who have told him since childhood that his dreams
                    can never be realized. Santiago has to understand that those who truly love him will not
                    begrudge him the pursuit of his dreams. Then, he must hold back fear of failure and defeat
                    to continue his quest. Last, he has to understand that the worst thing in life is to deny
                    one's dreams.

                    This is definitely a religious novel, but that makes impactful claims about the human
                    condition and what it means to struggle. This isn't as action packed as some of the other
                    books on the list, but definitely has tension and will make you feel something within
                    your soul.
